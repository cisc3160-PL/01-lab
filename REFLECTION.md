# Reflection

## Problem Domains

**Online Whiteboard**:
- Languages(s) selected and rationale for selection:
    - JavaScript, HTML, CSS
    - Flexible and ease of deployment for the web, and on GitHub Pages
    - Using newfound knowledge on this project was good practice
- What about the language made it easy?
    - Prior knowledge and experience
    - Excellent MDN documentation
- What about the language made it difficult?
    - Recently learned about the Canvas API in CISC 3610
    - Much of my experience with JavaScript is in using existing libraries and frameworks like React.js, so going back to pure JS was a bit challenging
- If you had to solve the problem again, would you choose a different language?
    - Canvas API is pretty robust for drawing graphics on the web, so I would probably stick with it.

**Procedural Generation w/ Visualizer**:
- Languages(s) selected and rationale for selection:
    - JavaScript, HTML, CSS
    - Working with Canvas API for the previous project, I decided to take it a step further, so I stuck with it
- What about the language made it easy?
    - Prior knowledge and experience
    - Excellent MDN documentation
- What about the language made it difficult?
    - Recently learned about the Canvas API in CISC 3610
    - Much of my experience with JavaScript is in using existing libraries and frameworks like React.js, so going back to pure JS was a bit challenging
- If you had to solve the problem again, would you choose a different language?
    - I had experience working with procedural generation in Unity C# in the past, and they have their own implementation of simplex and perlin noise. The most popular noise implementation in JS had limited functionality, and not many parameters to tweak. Instead of choosing another language, I'd rather port over the C# noise implementation to JS.

**Web Development (displaying stats from SpaceX)**:
- Languages(s) selected and rationale for selection:
    - JavaScript, HTML, CSS
    - Usually when I write client code, I would use React.js. I figured it would be a good idea to fetch some data in pure JS and display it, just to get a feel of the native functionalities.
- What about the language made it easy?
    - Prior knowledge and experience
    - Excellent MDN documentation
- What about the language made it difficult?
    - Not much modularity with HTML and JS separated, unlike the React.js method of embedding HTML in JS.
    - It's been a while since I've done DOM manipulation in pure JS.
- If you had to solve the problem again, would you choose a different language?
    - With my newfound appreciation for React.js making things easy, I think I will go back to React.js
